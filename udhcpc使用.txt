你需要的只是udhcpc script

Udhcpc is a very small DHCP client program geared towards embedded systems. The letters are an abbreviation for Micro - DHCP - Client (μDHCPc). The program tries to be fully functional and RFC 2131 compliant.

It was once packaged with a similarly small DHCP server program named udhcpd, with the package called udhcp. It is now maintained as part of Busybox.
