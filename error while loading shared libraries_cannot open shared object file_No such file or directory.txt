Your library is a dynamic library. You need to tell the operating system where it can locate it at runtime.

To do so, we will need to do those easy steps:

(1 ) Find where the library is placed if you don't know it.

cd /
sudo find ./ | grep the_name_of_the_file.so
(2) Check for the existence of the dynamic library path environnement variable(LD_LIBRARY_PATH)

$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
if there is nothing to be display we need to add the default path value (or not as you wich)

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
(3) We add the desire path and export it and try the application

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/my_library/path.so.something
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ ./my_app

当然，你也可以静态编译啦，只要加一个-static选项就OKl ，例如：
To compile a statically linked version of the program, use the -static flag in gcc,

$ gcc -static example.o -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm
